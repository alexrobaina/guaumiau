# GuauMiau Mobile App

React Native mobile application for the GuauMiau pet services platform.

## 🚀 Quick Start

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 20
- npm or pnpm (package manager)
- iOS: Xcode and CocoaPods
- Android: Android Studio and SDK

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# iOS: Install CocoaPods dependencies
cd ios && bundle install && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
```

### Running the App

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
